## Appwrite Configuration

### Indexes

All indexes must be **Fulltext** type. Using Key type will cause a MySQL 767-byte limit error.

| Collection | Attribute | Index Name |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | `username` | `username_index` |
| `files` | `username` | `username_index` |
| `reports` | `company` | `company_index` |

### Permissions

For each collection and the storage bucket, add role `Any` with Create and Read permissions.

- `users` — Any: Create, Read
- `posts` — Any: Create, Read
- `comments` — Any: Create, Read
- `files` — Any: Create, Read
- `reports` — Any: Create, Read
- Storage bucket `media` — Any: Create, Read

### Web Platform (CORS fix)

To run in a browser on localhost, register a Web platform in Appwrite:

Appwrite Console → Settings → Platforms → Add Platform → Web → Hostname: `localhost`

Add your production domain here before deploying.

## Fonts

| Font | Package | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Otomanopee One | `@expo-google-fonts/otomanopee-one` | Titles, headings, brand name |
| Ledger | `@expo-google-fonts/ledger` | Body text, buttons, inputs, labels |

Both fonts are loaded per-screen using `useFonts()`. Each screen shows an `ActivityIndicator` spinner until fonts are ready.

## Known Limitations

- **Passwords are stored as plain text.** Acceptable for a prototype — replace with hashed passwords (e.g. bcrypt) before any production release.
- **Voice-activated recording** in `Recording2.jsx` is a UI demo only. Real speech recognition requires a native module such as `@react-native-voice/voice`.
- **Lawyer payments** in `legal-lawyer.jsx` are a demo — the Pay To Start buttons show an alert. A real payment provider (e.g. Stripe) is needed before launch.
- **No persistent login session** — users must log in again each time the app is opened. Implement secure session storage for production.
- **File uploads on web** use the `appwrite` web SDK. Native uses `react-native-appwrite`. Both paths are handled automatically via `Platform.OS` detection.
- The app has been tested on **web (browser)** and **Android (Expo Go)**. iOS behaviour should be verified separately.
